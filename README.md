# Milk Money

Milk Money is an easy way to add cash transaction to lunchmoney via your developer token.

There's some stuff to do:

1. Make this a PWA
1. Turn on strict type checking
1. Audit for best PWA practices
1. Color audit
1. Button audit
1. Display different top categories depending on whether user selects income or expense

(And when I say audit, I mean, like, how can this be better.)
